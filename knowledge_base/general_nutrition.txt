A balanced diet includes a mix of macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
Carbohydrates are for energy. Good sources are whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Proteins are for building and repairing tissue. Good sources are lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, and tofu.
Fats are for hormone production and nutrient absorption. Healthy fats are found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
A diet high in processed foods, sodium, and saturated fats can lead to negative health outcomes.
