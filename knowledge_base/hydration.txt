Proper hydration is key for energy and brain function. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water per day.
Sugary drinks like soda and high-sugar fruit juices should be limited as they provide empty calories and can lead to blood sugar spikes.
Coffee and tea are acceptable in moderation, but water should be the primary source of hydration.
